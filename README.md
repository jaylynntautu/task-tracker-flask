like copy and paste this directly in there: # Overview

I created this software to learn how web applications work using a Python web
framework. My goal was to learn how a web server, HTML pages, and a database
work together in one program.

This software is a Task Tracker web app built with Flask and SQLite. The user
can add tasks, edit tasks, mark tasks as completed, and filter tasks by status
(All, Active, Completed). The web pages are created dynamically based on user
input and data stored in the database.

The purpose of this project was to practice building a simple but complete web
application and understand how web frameworks handle requests and responses.

I had some previous exposure to Flask during my internship, but this project
helped me better understand how to build a complete web application from
scratch, including routing, templates, and database integration.

used as the database to store tasks. HTML and CSS were used for the user
interface.

Technologies used:

- Python
- Flask
- SQLite
- HTML
- CSS

# How to Run the Program

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/jaylynntautu/task-tracker

2. Go into the project folder:

cd task-tracker


3. Create a virtual environment:

py -m venv venv


4. Activate the virtual environment:

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


5. Install required packages:

py -m pip install -r requirements.txt


6. Run the program:

py app.py


7. Open a browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000


The database file (`tasks.db`) will be created automatically the first time the
program runs.

# AI Disclosure

I used AI tools to help with setup, debugging, and improving documentation and
design. I reviewed and understood all final code.
